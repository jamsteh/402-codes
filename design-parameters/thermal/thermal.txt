The goals of the thermal subsystem are:
1. Keep all components and other subsystems within operating temperature ranges
2. Minimize power consumption within these boundaries.

Need to have:
- balance temperature
- surface area of satellite

Assumptions:
1. satellite is a cube
2. satellite is absorbing solar energy on one side and radiating
    on all six sides
3. 

antenna:
dipole 
patch 
parabolic if high requirement for data rate
batch 6-8 or 9 db of gain
can get transmitter that goes with that

antenna / transmitter two most important and influential things
start with 1 watt and see what it looks like
start with downlink not uplink
11 thousand pixels is quite a few
